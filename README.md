### Our project 
Our project is a website which focuses on places to eat or visit around Space4. Users can view the different places that have been reviewed when they visit the landing page and after they have signed up (and logged in) they can leave their own reviews and comment on other users reviews.


### User Stories 
* When I visit the website I can see reviews about food/recreation around Space4
* When I visit the website I can see a general rating (%) of a given place (stretch?)
* After I have signed up I can leave a review of a place (Will be implemented in week 2 of database)

### Our Process 
Day 1
We discussed project ideas and decided to do something around space4 and places to eat or visit. 

We created a basic software architecture and mapped out our file structure. We also used an online tool ([Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)) to draw our database schema.


### Database schema & documentation

Our database consists of 3 tables: 
* users 
* reviews
* place
